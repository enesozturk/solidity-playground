## App Front-Ends & Web3.js

## Chapter1: Intro to Web3.js

The Ethereum network is made up of nodes, with each containing a copy of the blockchain. When you want to call a function on a smart contract, you need to query one of these nodes and tell it:

- The address of the smart contract
- The function you want to call, and
- The variables you want to pass to that function.

Ethereum nodes only speak a language called `JSON-RPC`, which isn't very human-readable. A query to tell the node you want to call a function on a contract looks something like this:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_sendTransaction",
  "params": [
    {
      "from": "0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155",
      "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
      "gas": "0x76c0",
      "gasPrice": "0x9184e72a000",
      "value": "0x9184e72a",
      "data": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675"
    }
  ],
  "id": 1
}
```

Web3.js hides these nasty queries below the surface, so you only need to interact with a convenient and easily readable JavaScript interface.

Instead of needing to construct the above query, calling a function in your code will look something like this:

```js
CryptoZombies.methods
  .createRandomZombie("Vitalik Nakamoto ðŸ¤”")
  .send({ from: "0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155", gas: "3000000" });
```
