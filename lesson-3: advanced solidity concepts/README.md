## Advanced Solidity Concepts

## Chapter 1: Immutability of Contracts

After you deploy a contract to Ethereum, itâ€™s `immutable`, which means that it can never be modified or updated again.

The initial code you deploy to a contract is there to stay, permanently, on the blockchain. This is one reason security is such a huge concern in Solidity. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there's no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix.

But this is also a feature of smart contracts. The code is law. If you read the code of a smart contract and verify it, you can be sure that every time you call a function it's going to do exactly what the code says it will do. No one can later change that function and give you unexpected results.

> `setKittyContractAddress` function is `external`, so anyone can call it! That means anyone who called the function could change the address of the CryptoKitties contract, and break our app for all its users. This is a security hole!
